# Milestones and Major Projects

A major pillar of validating the reliability of software in production is **monitoring**, which is the collection and aggregation of metrics about a system. Having metrics allows for building dashboards for introspection, alerting, analyzing trends, and more.

One of the first systems I was exposed to at ecobee was the thermostat backend's monitoring system. This monitoring and alerting system consisted of an stack of Grafana, Prometheus, AlertManager, and PagerDuty. This collection of tools is quite standard across many software organizations, with some organizations opting for cloud-based offerings to replace parts of the stack.

Over the two work terms, I've become a (self-declared) subject matter expert in monitoring methodology and systems. Due to my interest and developing knowledge on the topic, I had the opportunities to:
* build up entire monitoring stacks for a multiple teams
* build a connector for Prometheus to discover Amazon ECS services, now a critical component in the monitoring systems for two products
* monitor systems with CloudWatch (Amazon AWS) logging and alerting
* monitor systems with Stackdriver (Google Cloud Platform) logging and alerting
* learn PromQL to write and manipulate Prometheus queries 
* work in-depth with the Prometheus time series database

I'm proud to have this subject matter under my belt, and I'm very interested to gain experience with distributed tracing and large-scale logging in the future.

# Goals

### 1. Get a well-rounded understanding of the responsibilities of a Production Engineer.

### 2. Learn the failure response process for end-user-facing services.

### 3. I am tasked with a fairly large project of designing an automated QA deployment. I want to complete this project by the end of the term, and do so in a timely manner.

### 4. Bring a squad's architecture to Kubernetes.

This goal was intended to be a project that I would take on in my own time, in an attempt to both learn Kubernetes through hands on experience, while simulataneously gaining in-depth knowledge of a squad's infrastructure. 

The quarterly hackathon (Hack the Hive) turned out to be an excellent opportunity to attempt this goal.

### 5.
