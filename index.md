## Introduction.
What should you take away from this site? Short and sweet, I'm about to tell you.

## Jibestream
Jibestream is a company of many mapping-related talents. At its heart, Jibestream provides an indoor navigation and mapping service through several products, spanning several SDKs across multiple platforms. Their clients also span multiple verticals, from mall corporations like Westfield and GGP, to government, such as The Pentagon.

### A typical client-side workflow
Let's say a mall is looking to add an indoor map into their existing app. If they turned to Jibestream, they would start by submitting architectural diagrams of their buildings to Jibestream’s mapping team, who in turn would convert the map into a vector representation for the mapping engine. Then, Jibestream would provide the mall with SDKs to implement map and navigation features that the mall would like to have in their app. Finally, mall managers could tweak almost all facets of navigation and mall features through Jibestream’s CMS (Content Management System).

### Creating pages manually
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

### Authors and Contributors
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
