## Jibestream
![Jibestream Logo][jslogo]  
Jibestream is a company of many mapping-related talents. At its heart, they provide an indoor navigation and mapping service through several products, spanning several SDKs across multiple platforms. Their clients also span multiple verticals, from mall corporations like Westfield and GGP, to government, such as The Pentagon.

### A typical client-side workflow
Let's say a mall is looking to add an indoor map into their existing app. If they turned to Jibestream, they would start by submitting architectural diagrams of their buildings to Jibestream’s mapping team, who in turn would convert the map into a vector representation for the mapping engine. Then, Jibestream would provide the mall with SDKs to implement map and navigation features that the mall would like to have in their app. Finally, mall managers could tweak almost all facets of navigation and mall features through Jibestream’s CMS (Content Management System).
