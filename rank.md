# Rank Software

# Introduction
Summary here, what did I learn from Rank in a sentence or two.

In short, what is Rank software, and what do they do.

# Work Term Goals

### 1. I would like to improve my presentational skills, specifically with respect to verbal communication. In running a presentation, my goal is specifically to maximize the audience's understanding of the purpose and inner workings of my solution.

For several hours leading up to the scheduled presentation, I prepared content topics that I would present on into detailed breakdowns. This proved to be incredibly useful. The presentation became an informal demonstration and walkthrough of the API I had written, and I was able to get through the content I had prepared successfully and on time.

I also received some specific feedback from my manager, where one point highlighted the “tell-show- tell” presentation technique. My shortcoming was not making sure everyone was on the same page before demonstrating a feature, so talking about what I was about to show (the first “tell”) would solve this problem.

### 2. Rank's product is backed by machine learning. I would like to gain a basic, well-rounded understanding of machine learning, in order to better internalize our product's problem domain.

By the end of the work term, I was successful in reading 7 papers spanning a few ML (machine learning) topics. This proved to be a fairly effective method of gaining domain knowledge and understanding the problems that exist within the product space, perhaps second to actually developing ML applications in my own time.

Reading academic papers was a new experience, and I learned that there are methods of reading these papers to maximize one’s understanding of them (in short, not simply reading sequentially).

In reading the papers, I was surprised at the frequency of which the same domain-related hurdles would come up in different papers. True to form, some of these topics would come up in the workplace, and they became great sources of discussion to further my understanding. I will certainly be applying this method in the future.

### 3. My final project at Rank will be timeboxed by the end of my co-op term in August. My goal is to manage my time effectively to complete this final project in its entirety.

This goal was intentionally vague, since at the time, the topic and time available for the final project were to be determined. In the end, the task was to evaluate the effectiveness of an ML algorithm in production. The task itself was originally estimated at 4 weeks, but there were only about 1 ½ weeks remaining in the work term. To remediate this, I re-evaluated the goal and built a schedule that mapped each day to my approximate progress.

Breaking the task down into a solidified and fine-grained schedule aided me in providing concrete daily progress updates. It also helped keep me from deviating from the task or getting stuck, and made it clear when I was ahead of schedule. I used this time ahead as an opportunity to branch out of the core task to try an interesting evaluation mechanism, which ended up providing great value to the final report.
